# 🖼️ Image Super-Resolution Using CNN (SRCNN)

This project implements a deep learning-based **image super-resolution** system using a **Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN)**. The model enhances low-resolution images by learning the complex mapping to high-resolution counterparts.

## 🔍 What is Image Super-Resolution?

Image Super-Resolution is the task of **reconstructing a high-resolution (HR) image from a low-resolution (LR) image**. It has applications in medical imaging, satellite imaging, security footage enhancement, and more.
